Programming Assignment #5

Objectives:

      1. using register indirect addressing

      2. passing parameters

      3. generating “random” numbers

      4. working with arrays

      5. understanding interface design

Description:

Write and test a MASM program to perform the following tasks: 

      1. Introduce the program.

      2. Get a user request in the range [16, 256]--[min, max].

      3. Generate request random integers in the range [64, 1024]--[lo, hi], storing them in consecutive elements of an array.

      4. Display the list of integers before sorting, 5 numbers per line.

      5. Sort the list in descending order (i.e., largest first).

      6. Calculate and display the median value, rounded to the nearest integer.

      7. Calculate and display the average value, rounded to the nearest integer.

      8. Display the sorted list, 5 numbers per line.
