CS 271 Computer Architecture and Assembly Language

Programming Assignment #4

Objectives:

    1. Designing and implementing procedures
    
    2. Designing and implementing loops

    3. Writing nested loops

    4. Understanding data validation

Problem Definition:

    • Write a program to calculate composite numbers. 
    
    • First, the user is instructed to enter the number of composites to be displayed, and is prompted to enter an integer in the range [1 .. 400].  
    
    • The user enters a number, n, and the program verifies that 1 ≤ n≤ 400.  
    
    • If n is out of range, the user is re-prompted until s/he enters a value in the specified range.  
    
    • The program then calculates and displays all of the composite numbers up to and including the nth composite.  
    
    • The results should be displayed 8 composites per line with at least 3 spaces between the numbers.
